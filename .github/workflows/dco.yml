            Your commits are missing the required "Signed-off-by" line.

            ### How to fix this:

            1. **For new commits**, use the \`-s\` flag:
               \`\`\`bash
               git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
               \`\`\`

            2. **To fix existing commits** in your PR:
               \`\`\`bash
               # For the last commit
               git commit --amend --signoff

               # For multiple commits (replace N with number of commits)
               git rebase --signoff HEAD~N

               # Force push the updated commits
               git push --force-with-lease
               \`\`\`

            ### What is DCO?

            The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a legally lightweight way for contributors to confirm they have the right to submit code to the project.

            By signing off, you certify that:
            - You wrote the code or have the right to submit it
            - You agree to the project's license terms
            - Your contribution follows the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)
