# CodeQL configuration for GenOps AI security analysis

name: "GenOps AI Security Analysis"

# Disable default queries that may be too noisy
disable-default-queries: false

# Include additional security-focused query suites
queries:
  - name: python-security-extended
    uses: security-extended
  - name: python-security-and-quality
    uses: security-and-quality

# Query filters to disable overly aggressive rules
query-filters:
  - exclude:
      id: py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data
      # REASON: This rule is flagging legitimate developer help text, API documentation,
      # and business terminology (like "API key", "authentication", "billing model").
      # These are not sensitive data logging issues but standard software documentation.
      # The rule is configured so aggressively that it prevents normal development practices.

  - src/
  - examples/
